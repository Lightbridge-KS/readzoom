#' Process Class Session & Multiple Device
#'
#' Add column `Session` for each grouping (`Name (Original Name)`, `Email`) by ranking `Join_Time`.
#' If `Join_Time` is exactly the same for each grouping, ranking will not increase.
#' Add column `Multi_Device` that check whether sessions of each grouping are overlapped with any others.
#' For overlapping sessions, `TRUE` will be placed at those sessions, otherwise `NA`.
#'
#' @param df_cleaned Cleaned data.frame
#'
#' @return A tibble with column "Session" and "Multi_Device" added.
